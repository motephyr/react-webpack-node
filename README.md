I do some job, from mongoose(use mongo) to bookshelfjs(use postgresql).     
And In Redux, I use decorator(ES7) , maybe somebody can reference.    
 
bookshelfjs: http://bookshelfjs.org/     
decorator: https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841#.41gj8tmv9     
(but redux's creator don't recommend this feature, if you want use it. please thinking about it again.)
